statements vs expression

  - expression is a a piece of code that produces a value
    5 + 3 = 9 is an expression
    - the value  9 is an expression
  
  - statements are actions
    if (20 > 10) {
      console.log("true")
    }
    - A statement does not produce a value, it only performs an action.
