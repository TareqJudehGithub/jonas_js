Data Types in JS

 - In JS, a value can be either an object, or a primitive.
 - JS has dynamic typing. We don't have to manually define a data type
   for declaring variables.
 
Number
  - Used for BOTH decimals and integers (whole numbers).

String 
  - A sequence of characters quoted between double/single quotations.

Boolean
 - Logical type that can only be true or false.
 - Used for decision making.

Undefined
 - A variable that has yet no value (declared but not initialed with a value);

Null
 - Empty value.

Symbol
 - Not used much. Value that is unique but cannot be changed

BigInt 
 - Larger integers than the Number type can hold.
