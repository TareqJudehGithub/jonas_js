/* 
 - Variables in JS cannot start with a number.
    3years  - This is wrong and will lead to an error.
 - Variables cannot contain symbols like @, #, or ! 
 - Variables cannot be reserved JS words (like class).
    Although it works, never call your variable name.
 - Don't start your variable with an upper letter, or PascalCase, instead
   use camelCase.
 - variable names should always be descriptive.
