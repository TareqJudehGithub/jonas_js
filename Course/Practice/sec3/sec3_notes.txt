"use strict"
 - "use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in 
   "strict mode".
 - strict mode should be the very first line of code..
 - It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions 
   of JavaScript.
 - he purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in 
   "strict mode".  
 - With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.
 - Strict mode helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using 
   undeclared variables.
 
Why Strict Mode?
 - Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
 - Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
 - As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new 
 - global variable. In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible 
   to accidentally create a global variable.
